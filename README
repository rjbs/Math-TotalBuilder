README for Math-TotalBuilder

This module provides two subroutines, build and total, which can be used to
handle quantities of valued items. These can be used to build the proper tender
to represent a quantity of money, to compose a mass from standard weights, to
convert a difference of seconds to a set of time units, or other similar
calculations.

 use Math::TotalBuilder;

 my %lsd = ( pound => 240, shilling => 20, penny => 1 );

 # units for 952 pence
 my %tender = build(\%lsd, 952);

 # total value of 3, 21, 98
 my $wealth = total(\%lsd, { pound => 3, shilling => 21, penny => 98 });

 # best better representation of 18, 6, 40
 my %moolah = build(\%lsd,
   total (\%lsd, { pound => 18, shilling => 6, penny => 40 }));
