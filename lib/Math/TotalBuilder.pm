Math::TotalBuilder -- build a whole total out of valued pieces

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::TotalBuilder;

 my %lsd = ( pound => 240, shilling => 20, penny => 1 );

 # units for 952 pence
 my %tender = build(\%lsd, 952);

 # total value of 3, 21, 98
 my $wealth = total(\%lsd, { pound => 3, shilling => 21, penny => 98 });

 # best better representation of 18, 6, 40
 my %moolah = build(\%lsd,
   total (\%lsd, { pound => 18, shilling => 6, penny => 40 }));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides two subroutines, C<build> and C<total>, which can be used
to handle quantities of valued items.  These can be used to build the proper
tender to represent a quantity of money, to compose a mass from standard
weights, to convert a difference of seconds to a set of time units, or other
similar calculations.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C< build(\%pieces, $total, \@code) >

  my %nicetime = build (
    { days => 86400, hours => 3600, minutes => 60, seconds => 1 },
    39102
  );

This routine takes a hash of valued units and a total, and it returns the
quantity of each unit required to build that total.  If the total can't be
cleanly built, the routine will return a set that builds the nearest total it
can, without going over.  A special value, C<_remainder> will indicate by how
many units it fell short.

This module does not solve the knapsack problem, and hardly tries.  It may fail
to provide a solution for solveable instances, like this:

 my $difficult = build (
   { kroener => 30, talen => 7 },
   49
 ); 
 # yields { kroener => 1, talen => 2, _remainder => 5 }
 # not    { talen => 7 }

The third, optional, argument to C<build> must be either a coderef or a
reference to an array of coderefs, each of which accept C<\%pieces> and
C<$total> as arguments.  C<build> will return the result of building a total
using the passed sub.  If an arrayref of coderefs was passed, C<build> will
construct a total using each sub and return the total with the smallest
remainder.

If no third option is passed, C<&build_basic>, a very simple-minded algorithm,
is assumed.

=cut

sub build {
	$_[2] ||= \&build_basic;
	if (ref $_[2] eq 'ARRAY') { 
		%{(
			sort { $a->{_remainder} <=> $b->{_remainder} }
			map  { { $_->($_[0], $_[1]) } } @{$_[2]}
		)[0]};
	} elsif (ref $_[2] eq 'CODE') { 
		return $_[2]->($_[0], $_[1]);
	} else {
		croak "bad third parameter to build";
	}
}

=item C< build_basic(\%pieces, $total) >

This is the basic algorithm used to build totals.  It uses as many of the
largest unit will fit, then as many of the next largest, and so on, until it
has tried to fit all the units in.

=cut

sub build_basic { 
	my ($pieces, $total) = @_;

	return unless $total;

	my %result;

	for (sort { $pieces->{$b} <=> $pieces->{$a} } keys %$pieces) {
		next unless $pieces->{$_} <= $total;
		$result{$_} = int( $total / $pieces->{$_} );
		$total -= $result{$_} * $pieces->{$_};
	}

	$result{_remainder} = $total if $total;

	return %result;
}

=item C< total(\%pieces, \%set) >

 my $total = total(
   { ten => 10, five => 5, one => 1 },
   { ten =>  2, five => 6 }
 ); # returns 50

This routines returns the total value of the units in C<%set>, valued according
to the definition in %pieces.

=cut

sub total {
	my ($pieces, $set) = @_;
	my $total;
	for (keys %$set) {
		die "invalid unit type: $_" unless exists $pieces->{$_};
		$total += $set->{$_} * $pieces->{$_};
	}
	$total;
}

=head1 NOTES

This module isn't exactly ready for use.  It needs much more error-handling.
The sub names may be changed in the future to avoid conflict, since they're
very simple names, but probably not.  (If so, the current names will remain
exportable.)

=head1 TODO

=over

=item *

Use subrefs for ever-extending pieces.  (I<e.g.>, "powers of two")

=item *

Allow building a total from a given set of source units.  ("I have this many
units to try and build into this total.  Can I?")

=item * 

Allow for useful handling of pieces-sets with multiple pieces of the same
value: always use one, randomly distribute, etc.

=item * 

Allow use of bigfloats so that the smallest value need not be the base value.

=item *

Provide an option to try harder to build totals.
